# Keep Learning

Project to learning, testing and trying new things.

Website: https://lively-mud-06f3bca03.4.azurestaticapps.net/country

Everything on azure its from free plans, so sometimes you need to go to the website and then wait some time to start sql server.

On configuration I set auto-pause delay for sql server (free plan), after 1 hour without any action sql server stops.
